title: About the author

My name is Kryštof Pešek, this is my temporary braindump site containing notes sorted by date. I used to write some texts in the begginning, nowadays I found it hard to sit and write consistently in language I do not master.

All the posts which appears here with all changes to it were commited and logged into form of git repository, this can be considered as a complete _deep--media_ archive having its historical states along. As you can notice all the posts presented on this page may change over time and should not be considered as polished result, it is ever--changing work in progress. I still try to antidate notes, there may be mistakes.
