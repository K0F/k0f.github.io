The incidences of this act of spreading logical infrastructure are unknown, but its scale is enormous.</p><p>Dominance of English language as a world-wide common speech is quite evident nowadays. The interconnected network founded and spread recently (roughly in past 20 years) made this fact even more manifest. Technology acts a new era colonization tool and spreads into last depths of human culture. A soft discreet reality cannot be observed without proper devices but it is starting to be present in physical one. The division of two start to dissolve as a motives ideas and thoughts cannot be separated from what we usually gets form physical world natively.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/C13BWrA.png" alt="Image Alt" /></p><p>A single thought (say, set of information) can be technically spread with speed of light around a globe and it can be available in any reachable point. What is a necessity for being part of this info-sphere is a proper reading/writing device which can operate on standards of communication. A number of such devices increases rapidly but the general diversity of use is heavily decreasing.</p><p>All this we probably know already, but there is something underlying this strange phenomena.</p><p>True international language appeared in depths of technologies used nowadays. As far as their source codes are available for reading (i.e. TCP/IP protocol), instructions to computer and derived programs are creating true international language of nowadays. This enormous reservoir of all knowledge translated into common computer language is true breakthrough in human history. The internet revolution and so called informational society is happening not only at the <em>surface</em> of web-browsers (what we call the Internet mostly nowadays), but very structurally under the hood. Open standards in form of programming languages are creating common ground for all kind human thoughts. The number of massive standardization can possibly lead into better understanding of all nuances of connected (and educated) human mind and promises completely new level of collaboration across the whole world.</p><p>Free (or libre) software development is one of brightest examples of such creative collaboration. What it teaches us is, how wonderful could the world be if we could bridge a <em>Babylon confusion</em>. Adopting a technical language is not that new phenomena by itself. Nature sciences tried to achieve the very goal by defining an artificial semantic structures of mathematics. Formal systems that could lay a common ground for any logical consequences. As is was formulated and put together on very same basis and a computer (the machine of thought) had evolved into general computational machine. Nowadays with a help of more democratized encyclopedias of the laws of nature, some deterministic processes, recently even chemical and biological are being translated into computer language, the mathematics of nowadays. What more, within a second it could alter a human brain with speed of light around the globe or even beyond it.</p><p>…</p><p><em>text is in never-ending process..</em></p><p>∞</p><!-- ##notes: - you can program just what you can understand (really?) - metamorphosis based on context of program (killing machines, art installations, stock-exchange algorithms) - free culture as a necessity for all the education (free software as a model for all human creation) - problems of rewards and sustainability of free culture movement (volunteers and philanthropists) - If there is any unit in informational society it is not _bit_, but *person*. - more to write.. --></article><div class="back"> <a href="/">Back</a></div></main></body></html>
