All matter and energy are in constant motion. It is unstoppable, and even capturing or precisely documenting any process doesn’t remove it from this framework. We might think that sound recording or photography freezes time, but this isn’t quite accurate. The same time and energy are needed for our perception to interpret it. Light needs to be reflected towards our eyes, and vibrations of air pressure deliver sound to our ears. Information itself is the change from non-information, and therefore it requires a change in state.

We might think, and even hope, for something to be fixed in the universe; the hunt for formulas able to describe certain behavior is evident. But even this description needs extremely plastic matter to convey meaning. The human brain reading and understanding a formula or this text needs to perform billions of operations, expending about 30 watts of energy powered by the body’s own reserves. In this way, all organisms need a constant flow of energy through their bodies to operate. And there is no way to step out of this circle while keeping an organism alive. An idea of information floating above all this is not only wrong but completely misleading.

Recordings of events do not create a second universe but a reflection within this one. All known means of capturing a process are just creating an illusion of repeating an event—what a horrible mistake! There is nothing repeating at all; everything just flows along its complex paths, and all we can do is observe it to the fullest extent possible. This glorious victory of nature is all-absorbing, and no revolution of mind or matter can break these rules. We may split the atom and observe the wild dance of energy released, but we are unable to change how this will happen. There are islands of predictable matter in our CPUs able to behave deterministically, so we are probably able to calculate all their possible states even into the distant future, but even such understanding of one laboratory doesn’t break the laws.
